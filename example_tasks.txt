Write me a list of 300 tasks an advanced civilazation may want to perform when creating a settlment on mars.
Each task should be described in a way that it is at most 24 characters long.
None of the tasks should mention building anything like habitats.
Tasks should be made in a way that the later ones sometimes require the earlier ones to have been already done.
